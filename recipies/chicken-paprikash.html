    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is a classic Hungarian dinner, and one with a special place in my heart. When I was younger I would have this dish at least once a month. These days, now that I'm in college, it's a bit of a stretch to have somthing like this regularly, but I look forward to having some on the breaks. The dish consists of chicken, cooked in a sauce whose primary flavoring agent is paprika. This dish is usually served with dumplings, noodles, or rice. I have chosen to omit that from the recipie as all work and are simple enough to make.</p>
