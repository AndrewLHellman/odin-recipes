    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is a classic. It's my go to when I want something quick, that will fullfill any craving. Most of use are familiar with this, melty, gooey cheese inside crispy, toasted bread. Pairs well with tomato soup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread, sourdough is a good choice, but almost anything will work.</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2-4 ounces of cheese, shredded or thinly sliced. Can be one kind, can be 4. American is a classic, cheddar works well too. Havarti was my favorite when I was younger. I've heard good thinks about swiss, meunster and gruyere. Feel free to experiment.</li>
        <li>Garlic powder, optionally</li>
        <li>Black Pepper, optionally</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly toast the one side of the bread in the pan.</li>
        <li>Spread mayonnaise on the toasted side, as the optional garlic powder and black pepper onto the mayo.</li>
        <li>Place your cheese on one slice of bread, on top of the mayo. Close your sandwich keeping the mayo on the inside.</li>
        <li>Melt some butter in the pan, enough to coat the bottom of the pan (and maybe a bit more).</li>
        <li>Keeping the heat low enough to stop the bread from burning before the cheese melt, but high enough to finish the sandwich in a reasonable timeframe, place the sandwich in the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the bottom of the bread is toasted, flip the sandwich.</li>
        <li>Once the bottom of the second side is toasted, if the cheese is visibly melted take the sandwich out. If the cheese is not melted keep flipping every 30-60 seconds until the cheese is melted or the bread is slightly burnt.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with salt, serve however you like, and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
