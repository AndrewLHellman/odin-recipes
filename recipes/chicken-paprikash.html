    <h1>Chicken Paprikash</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken-paprikash.jpg" width="600" height="400">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is a classic Hungarian dinner, and one with a special place in my heart. When I was younger I would have this dish at least once a month. These days, now that I'm in college, it's a bit of a stretch to have somthing like this regularly, but I look forward to having some on the breaks. The dish consists of chicken, cooked in a sauce whose primary flavoring agent is paprika. This dish is usually served with dumplings, noodles, or rice. I have chosen to omit that from the recipie as all work and are simple enough to make.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons of lard or butter</li>
        <li>3 pounds of chicken pieces</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pepper, chopped. Ideally a hungarian wax pepper, but any mild pepper such as a poblano, should work.</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoons paprika, ideally Hungarian and sweet, can be hot if preffered. <strong>Definitely not smoked.</strong></li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspons salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cups sour cream, ideally full fat</li>
        <li>1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a heavy pot, such as a dutch oven head the lard/butter then brown the chicken on all sides. Set aside the chicken and add the onions until golden brown. Add garlic, tomatoes and the pepper and fry for 2-3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and add the paprika, pepper, and salt.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the pot and add the broth. Bring to boil, reduce to simmer and leave it there for 40 minutes. Remove the chicken again (or don't, it's not that important)</li>
        <li>In another bowl, stir the sour cream and heavy cream together, then add the flour and stir to form a paste. Stir the mixture into the sauce, whisking to prevent lumps. Simmer for another few minutes to allow the sauce to thicken slightly, then add salt and pepper to taste. Return the chicken and allow it to warm back up.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice, pasta, or nokedli/sp√§tzle</li>
    </ol>
